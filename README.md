Pokers
======

This is a Rust implementation of my first large programming assignment. It
simulates Texas Hold'em to calculate the exact chances of winning at any point
in the game.

### Origins
The original simulation was written in C++ and it is quite obvious that it was
written without a lot of programming knowledge. If you would like to laugh/cry
about the terribly ugly things that were written I encourage you to read the
source here: https://github.com/JelteF/poca. It also contains my started but
never finished version in C from a couple of years later.
